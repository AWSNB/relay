Getting started The Relay server is called relay . Binaries can be downloaded from the GitHub releases page . After downloading place the binary somewhere on your PATH and make it executable. The config init command is provided to initialize the initial config. The config will be created the folder it's run from in a hidden .relay subdirectory: $ relay config init The wizard will ask a few questions: default vs custom config. In the default config the relay will connect to sentry.io for sending and will generally use the defaults. In the custom config a different upstream can be configured. Relay internal crash reporting can be enabled or disabled. When enabled the relay will report its own internal errors to sentry.io to help us debug it. Lastly the relay will ask it should run authenticated with credentials or not. Currently we do not yet support authenticated mode against sentry.io. You now have a folder named .relay in your current working directory. To launch the server, run: relay run If you moved your config folder somewhere else, you can use the -c option: relay run -c ./my/custom/relay_folder/ Setting up a Project Right now Relay is only really usable in \"simple proxy mode\" (without credentials), and as such calls the same exact endpoints on Sentry that an SDK would. That also means you have to configure each project individually in Relay. Create a new file in the form project_id.json : .relay / projects / ___PROJECT_ID___.json With the following content: { \"publicKeys\" : [ { \"publicKey\" : \"___PUBLIC_KEY___\" , \"isEnabled\" : true } ], \"config\" : { \"allowedDomains\" : [ \"*\" ], \"piiConfig\" : {} } } The relay has to know all public keys (i.e. the secret part of the DSN) that will send events to it. DSNs unknown for this project will be rejected. Sending a Test Event Launch the server with relay run , and set up any SDK with the following DSN: http : //___PUBLIC_KEY___@127.0.0.1:3000/___PROJECT_ID___ As you can see we only changed the host and port of the DSN to point to your Relay setup. You should be able to use the SDK normally at this point. Events arrive at the Sentry instance that Relay is configured to use in .relay/config.yml . PII Stripping Now let's get to the entire point of this proxy setup: Stripping sensitive data. The easiest way to go about this is if you already have a raw JSON payload from some SDK. Go to our PII config editor Piinguin , and: Paste in a raw event Click on data you want eliminated Paste in other payloads and see if they look fine, go to step 2 if necessary. After iterating on the config, paste it back into the project config you created earlier: .relay / projects / ___PROJECT_ID___.json For example: { \"publicKeys\" : [ { \"publicKey\" : \"___PUBLIC_KEY___\" , \"isEnabled\" : true } ], \"config\" : { \"allowedDomains\" : [ \"*\" ], \"piiConfig\" : { \"rules\" : { \"device_id\" : { \"type\" : \"pattern\" , \"pattern\" : \"d/[a-f0-9]{12}\" , \"redaction\" : { \"method\" : \"hash\" } } }, \"applications\" : { \"freeform\" : [ \"device_id\" ] } } } }","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"The Sentry Relay is a work in progress service that pushes some functionality from the Sentry SDKs as well as the Sentry server into a proxy process.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"The Relay server is called relay .

RelayHistograms Histogram metrics used by Relay. event.queue_size.pct The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::EventQueueSizePct . The number of events in the queue as a percentage of the maximum number of events that can be stored in the queue ( 0 ... the queue is empty, 1 ... the queue is full and no additional events can be added). event.queue_size The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::EventQueueSize . The number of events in the queue. The event queue represents the events that are being processed at a particular time in Relay. Once a request is received the event has some preliminary (quick) processing to determine if it can be processed or it is rejected. Once this determination has been done the http request that created the event terminates and, if the request is to be further processed, the event enters a queue ( a virtual queue, the event is kept in a future that will resolve at some point in time). Once the event finishes processing and is sent downstream (i.e. the future is resolved and the event leaves relay) the event is considered handled and it leaves the queue ( the queue size is decremented). event.size_bytes.raw The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::EventSizeBytesRaw . The event size as seen by Relay after it is extracted from a request. event.size_bytes.uncompressed The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::EventSizeBytesUncompressed . The event size as seen by Relay after it has been decompressed and decoded (e.g. from Base64). project_state.pending The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::ProjectStatePending . Number of projects in the ProjectCache that are waiting for their state to be updated. project_state.request.batch_size The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::ProjectStateRequestBatchSize . Number of project state requested from the Upstream for the current batch request. project_state.received The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::ProjectStateReceived . Number of project states received from the Upstream for the current batch request. project_cache.size The metric is referred in code as: RelayHistograms::ProjectStateCacheSize . Number of project states currently held in the ProjectState cache. RelayTimers Timer metrics used by Relay event_processing.deserialize The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingDeserialize . The time spent deserializing an event from a JSON byte array into the native data structure on which Relay operates. event_processing.process Note : This metric is emitted only when Relay is built with the processing feature. The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingProcess . Time spent running event processors on an event. Event processing happens before filtering. event_processing.filtering Note : This metric is emitted only when Relay is built with the processing feature. The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingFiltering . Time spent running filtering on an event. event_processing.rate_limiting Note : This metric is emitted only when Relay is built with the processing feature. The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingRateLimiting . Time spent checking for rate limits in Redis. Note that not all events are checked against Redis. After an event is rate limited for period A, any event using the same key coming during period A will be automatically rate limited without checking against Redis (the event will be simply discarded without being placed in the processing queue). event_processing.pii The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingPii . Time spent in data scrubbing for the current event. event_processing.serialization The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingSerialization . Time spent converting the event from an Annotated into a String containing the JSON representation of the event. event.wait_time The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventWaitTime . Represents the time spent between receiving the event in Relay (i.e. beginning of the request handling) up to the time before starting synchronous processing in the EventProcessor. event.processing_time The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventProcessingTime . This is the time the event spends in the EventProcessor (i.e. the sync processing of the event). The time spent in synchronous event processing. This timing covers the end-to-end processing in the CPU pool and comprises: event_processing.deserialize event_processing.pii event_processing.serialization With Relay in processing mode, this includes the following additional timings: event_processing.process event_processing.filtering event_processing.rate_limiting event.total_time The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::EventTotalTime . The total time an event spends in Relay from the time it is received until it finishes processing. project_state.eviction.duration The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::ProjectStateEvictionDuration . The total time spent during ProjectCache.fetch_states in which eviction of outdated projects happens. project_state.request.duration The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::ProjectStateRequestDuration . The total time spent during ProjectCache.fetch_states spent waiting for all ProjectState requests to resolve. During a fetch_states request, we pick up to max_num_requests * max_num_project_states_per_request projects that need their state updated and batch them into max_num_requests requests. This metric represents the time spent from issuing the first request until all requests are finished. project_id.request.duration The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::ProjectIdRequestDuration . The total time spent getting the project id from upstream. Note that ProjectIdRequests happen only for the legacy endpoint that does not specify the project id in the url, for the new endpoints the project id is extracted from the url path. Only projects with the id not already fetched are counted. The project id is only fetched once and it is not refreshed. requests.duration The metric is referred in code as: RelayTimers::RequestsDuration . The total duration of a request as seen from Relay from the moment the request is received until a http result is returned. Note that this does not represent the total duration for processing an event. Requests for events that are not immediately rejected ( because the project has hit a rate limit) are scheduled for processing at a latter time and an HTTP OK (200) is returned. RelaySets Set metrics used by Relay unique_projects The metric is referred in code as: RelaySets::UniqueProjects . Represents the number of active projects in the current slice of time RelayCounters Counter metrics used by Relay event.accepted The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::EventAccepted . Number of events accepted in the current time slot. This represents events that have successfully passed rate limits, filters and have been successfully handled. event.rejected The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::EventRejected . Number of events rejected in the current time slot. This includes events being rejected because they are malformed or any other error during processing (including filtered events, discarded events and rate limited events). events.outcomes Note : This metric is emitted only when Relay is built with the processing feature. The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::EventOutcomes . Represents a group of counters, implemented with using tags. The following tags are present for each event outcome: outcome which is an EventOutcome enumeration reason which is the reason string for all outcomes that are not Accepted . project_state.get The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProjectStateGet . Counts the number of times a project state lookup is done. This includes requests for projects that are cached and requests for projects that are not yet cached. All requests that return a EventAction::Accept i.e. are not rate limited (on the fast path) or are discarded because we know the project is disabled or invalid will be counted. project_state.request The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProjectStateRequest . Counts the number of project state http requests. Note that a project state HTTP request typically contains a number of projects (the project state requests are batched). project_cache.hit The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProjectCacheHit . Counts the number of times a request for a project is already present, this effectively represents the fraction of project_state.get that will not result in a ProjectState request. project_cache.miss The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProjectCacheMiss . Counts the number of times a request for a project is not already present. project_state.get = project_cache.miss + project_cache.hit . Requests that are generating a cache hit will be queued and batched and eventually will generate a project_state.request . project_id.request The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProjectIdRequest . Counts the number of requests for the ProjectId (the timing is tracked by project_id.request.duration ). Note that ProjectIdRequests happen only for the legacy endpoint that does not specify the project id in the url, for the new endpoints the project id is extracted from the url path. Only projects with the id not already fetched are counted. Once the ProjectId is successfully cached it will be retained indefinitely. server.starting The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ServerStarting . Counts the number of times Relay started. This can be used to track unwanted restarts due to crashes or termination. processing.event.produced Note : This metric is emitted only when Relay is built with the processing feature. The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ProcessingEventProduced . Counts the number of messages placed on the Kafka queue. When Relay operates with processing enabled and a message is successfully processed each message will generate an event on the Kafka queue and zero or more attachments. The counter has an event_type tag which is set to either event or attachment representing the type of message produced on the Kafka queue. event.protocol The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::EventProtocol . Counts the number of events that hit any of the Store like endpoints (Store, Security, MiniDump, Unreal). The events are counted before they are rate limited , filtered or processed in any way. The counter has a version tag that tracks the message event protocol version. requests The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::Requests . Counts the number of requests reaching Relay. responses.status_codes The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::ResponsesStatusCodes . Counts the number of requests that have finished during the current interval. The counter has the following tags: status_code The HTTP status code number. method The HTTP method used in the request in uppercase. route Unique dashed identifier of the endpoint. project_cache.eviction The metric is referred in code as: RelayCounters::EvictingStaleProjectCaches . We are scanning our in-memory project cache for stale entries.

All keys are snake_case . Relay General relay settings. relay.mode : string, default: managed Controls the basic communication and configuration mode for this relay. Allowed values are: managed (default) : Project configurations are managed by Sentry, unless they are statically overridden via the file system. This requires credentials to be set up and white listed in Sentry. static : Projects must be statically configured on the file system. If configured, PII stripping is also performed on those events. Events for unknown projects are automatically rejected. proxy : Relay acts as a proxy for all requests and events. It will not load project configurations from the upstream or perform PII stripping. All events are accepted unless overridden on the file system. For more information on providing or overriding project configurations on the file system, please refer to Project Configuration and PII Configuration . relay.upstream : string, default: https://sentry.io The upstream relay or sentry instance. Important : Relay does not check for cycles. Ensure this option is not set to an endpoint that will cause events to be cycled back here. relay.host : string, default: 127.0.0.1 The host the relay should bind to (network interface). Example: 0.0.0.0 relay.port : integer, default: 3000 The port to bind for the unencrypted relay HTTP server. Example: 3000 relay.tls_port : integer, optional Optional port to bind for the encrypted relay HTTPS server. Example: 3001 This is in addition to the port option: If you set up a HTTPS server at tls_port , the HTTP server at port still exists. relay.tls_identity_path : string, optional The filesystem path to the identity (DER-encoded PKCS12) to use for the HTTPS server. Example: relay_dev.pfx relay.tls_identity_password : string, optional Password for the PKCS12 archive in tls_identity_path . HTTP Set various network-related settings. http.timeout : integer, default: 5 Timeout for upstream requests in seconds. http.max_retry_interval : integer, default: 60 Maximum interval between failed request retries in seconds. Caching Fine-tune caching of project state. cache.project_expiry : integer, default: 300 (5 minutes) The cache timeout for project configurations in seconds.

Relay can run as part of a Sentry installation, such as within sentry.io 's infrastructure, or next to the application as a forwarding proxy. A lot of steps described here are skipped or run in a limited form when Relay is not running with processing enabled: Event normalization does different (less) things. In certain modes, project config is not fetched from Sentry at all (but rather from disk or filled out with defaults). Events are forwarded to an HTTP endpoint instead of being written to Kafka. Rate limits are not calculated using Redis, instead Relay just honors 429s from previously mentioned endpoint. Filters are not applied at all. Inside the endpoint When an SDK hits /api/X/store on Relay, the code in server/src/endpoints/store.rs is called before returning a HTTP response. That code looks into an in-memory cache to answer basic information about a project such as: Does it exist? Is it suspended/disabled? Is it rate limited right now? If so, which key is rate limited? Which DSNs are valid for this project? Some of the data for this cache is coming from the projectconfigs endpoint . It is refreshed every couple of minutes, depending on configuration ( project_expiry ). If the cache is fresh, we may return a 429 for rate limits or a 4xx for invalid auth information. That cache might be empty or stale. If that is the case, Relay does not actually attempt to populate it at this stage. It just returns a 200 even though the event might be dropped later. This implies: The first store request that runs into a rate limit doesn't actually result in a 429 , but a subsequent request will (because by that time the project cache will have been updated). A store request for a non-existent project may result in a 200 , but subsequent ones will not. A store request with wrong auth information may result in a 200 , but subsequent ones will not. Filters are also not applied at this stage, so a filtered event will always result in a 200 . This matches the Python behavior since a while now . These examples assume that a project receives one event at a time. In practice one may observe that a highly concurrent burst of store requests for a single project results in 200 OK s only. However, a multi-second flood of incoming events should quickly result in eventually consistent and correct status codes. The response is completed at this point. All expensive work (such as talking to external services) is deferred into a background task. Except for responding to the HTTP request, there's no I/O done in the endpoint in any form. We didn't even hit Redis to calculate rate limits. Summary The HTTP response returned is just a best-effort guess at what the actual outcome of the event is going to be. We only return a 4xx code if we know that the response will fail (based on cached information), if we don't we return a 200 and continue to process the event asynchronously. This asynchronous processing used to happen synchronously in the Python implementation of StoreView . The effect of this is that the server will respond much faster that before but we might return 200 for events that will ultimately not be accepted. Generally Relay will return a 200 in many more situations than the old StoreView . The background task The HTTP response is out by now. The rest of what used to happen synchronously in the Python StoreView is done asynchronously, but still in the same process. So, now to the real work: Project config is fetched. If the project cache is stale or missing, we fetch it. We may wait a couple milliseconds ( batch_interval ) here to be able to batch multiple project config fetches into the same HTTP request to not overload Sentry too much. At this stage Relay may drop the event because it realized that the DSN was invalid or the project didn't even exist. The next incoming event will get a proper 4xx status code. The event is parsed. In the endpoint we only did decompression, a basic JSON syntax check, and extraction of the event ID to be able to return it as part of the response. Now we create an Event struct, which conceptually is the equivalent to parsing it into a Python dictionary: We allocate more memory. The event is normalized. Event normalization is probably the most CPU-intensive task running in Relay. It discards invalid data, moves data from deprecated fields to newer fields and generally just does schema validation. Filters (\"inbound filters\") are applied. Event may be discarded because of IP addresses, patterns on the error message or known web crawlers. Exact rate limits (\"quotas\") are applied. is_rate_limited.lua is executed on Redis. The input parameters for is_rate_limited.lua (\"quota objects\") are part of the project config. See this pull request for an explanation of what quota objects are. The event may be discarded here. If so, we write the rate limit info (reason and expiration timestamp) into the in-memory project cache so that the next store request returns a 429 in the endpoint and doesn't hit Redis at all. This contraption has the advantage that suspended or permanently rate-limited projects are very cheap to handle, and do not involve external services (ignoring the polling of the project config every couple of minutes). The event is datascrubbed. We have a PII config (new format) and a datascrubbing config (old format, converted to new format on the fly) as part of the project config fetched from Sentry. Event is written to Kafka. Note: If we discard an event at any point, an outcome is written to Kafka if Relay is configured to do so. Summary For events that returned a 200 we spawn an in-process background task that does the rest of what the old StoreView did. This task updates in-memory state for rate limits and disabled projects/keys. The outcomes consumer Outcomes are small messages in Kafka that contain an event ID and information about whether that event was rejected, and if so, why. The outcomes consumer is mostly responsible for updating (user-visible) counters in Sentry (buffers/counters and tsdb, which are two separate systems). The ingest consumer The ingest consumer reads accepted events from Kafka, and also updates some stats. Some of those stats are billing-relevant. Its main purpose is to do what insert_data_to_database in Python store did: Call preprocess_event , after which comes sourcemap processing, native symbolication, grouping, snuba and all that other stuff that is of no concern to Relay.

A lot of steps described here are skipped or run in a limited form when Relay is not running with processing enabled: Event normalization does different (less) things. In certain modes, project config is not fetched from Sentry at all (but rather from disk or filled out with defaults). Events are forwarded to an HTTP endpoint instead of being written to Kafka. Rate limits are not calculated using Redis, instead Relay just honors 429s from previously mentioned endpoint. Filters are not applied at all.","title":"Processing enabled vs not?"},{"location":"architecture/ingest-event-path/#inside-the-endpoint","text":"When an SDK hits /api/X/store on Relay, the code in server/src/endpoints/store.rs is called before returning a HTTP response. That code looks into an in-memory cache to answer basic information about a project such as: Does it exist? Is it suspended/disabled? Is it rate limited right now? If so, which key is rate limited? Which DSNs are valid for this project? Some of the data for this cache is coming from the projectconfigs endpoint . It is refreshed every couple of minutes, depending on configuration ( project_expiry ). If the cache is fresh, we may return a 429 for rate limits or a 4xx for invalid auth information. That cache might be empty or stale. If that is the case, Relay does not actually attempt to populate it at this stage. It just returns a 200 even though the event might be dropped later. This implies: The first store request that runs into a rate limit doesn't actually result in a 429 , but a subsequent request will (because by that time the project cache will have been updated). A store request for a non-existent project may result in a 200 , but subsequent ones will not. A store request with wrong auth information may result in a 200 , but subsequent ones will not. Filters are also not applied at this stage, so a filtered event will always result in a 200 . This matches the Python behavior since a while now . These examples assume that a project receives one event at a time. In practice one may observe that a highly concurrent burst of store requests for a single project results in 200 OK s only. However, a multi-second flood of incoming events should quickly result in eventually consistent and correct status codes. The response is completed at this point. All expensive work (such as talking to external services) is deferred into a background task. Except for responding to the HTTP request, there's no I/O done in the endpoint in any form. We didn't even hit Redis to calculate rate limits. Summary The HTTP response returned is just a best-effort guess at what the actual outcome of the event is going to be. We only return a 4xx code if we know that the response will fail (based on cached information), if we don't we return a 200 and continue to process the event asynchronously. This asynchronous processing used to happen synchronously in the Python implementation of StoreView . The effect of this is that the server will respond much faster that before but we might return 200 for events that will ultimately not be accepted.

You'd write: { \"applications\" : { \"$string\" : [ \"@ip:replace\" ] } } It reads as \"replace all IP addresses in all strings\", or \"apply @ip:replace to all $string fields\". @ip:replace is called a rule, and $string is a selector . Built-in rules The following rules exist by default: @ip:replace and @ip:hash for replacing IP addresses. @imei:replace and @imei:hash for replacing IMEIs @mac:replace , @mac:mask and @mac:hash for matching MAC addresses @email:mask , @email:replace and @email:hash for matching email addresses @creditcard:mask , @creditcard:replace and @creditcard:hash for matching creditcard numbers @userpath:replace and @userpath:hash for matching local paths (e.g. C:/Users/foo/ ) @password:remove for removing passwords.
